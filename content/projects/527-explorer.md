# 527 Explorer

Network visualization of ProPublica's [527 Explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/), built with [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/platform/framework).

## Demo

(so far ...)

## Why make this?

This project is in part, an extension of my prior research into nonprofit donations networks. 

I would like to write my own opinionated d3.js layout that deals with the scale-free and core-periphery characteristics of these networks. Having code to query and visualize a donations dataset was a first step.

I also have ambitions to create better looking interactive visualizations, and was curious by the interactivity provided by Observable.
